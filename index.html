      <h2>
        Neymar has made his first appearance on the training ground since his
        ACL injury but a photo doing the rounds on social media appear to show
        that he may not be in the best physical shape - thanks to an
        unflattering angle of the Brazilian. The Al-Hilal star has been out of
        action since October after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament
        against Uruguay while on international duty. Pictures emerged earlier
        this week showing the 32-year-old back in the gym and looking fit and in
        shape, as he looks to work his way back to full recovery. A video was
        also posted showing his first steps back on the training pitch. In a
        moment that transcended the confines of sport, Neymar Jr.'s injury
        during a match against Colombia sent waves of concern across Brazil,
        highlighting the nation's united passion for football and its heroes.
        Following a challenge by Colombia's Juan Zuniga, Neymar, a beacon of
        Brazilian football, was taken off the field, leading to an atmosphere of
        palpable silence among the 60,000 spectators at Estadio Castelao and
        nearly 200 million people nationwide. This incident not only showcases
        the collective emotional investment in football stars but also raises
        questions about the physical toll on elite athletes. Immediate Aftermath
        and National Reaction The incident occurred in Fortaleza, where Neymar,
        playing for Brazil, faced a tough challenge from Colombian player Juan
        Zuniga. The tackle resulted in Neymar being stretchered off the field, a
        moment that elicited a deafening silence from the crowd. This reaction
        was mirrored across Brazil, with fans and citizens alike feeling a deep
        sense of empathy and concern for Neymar's wellbeing. The event
        underscores the profound connection between Brazilian society and its
        football icons, reflecting how deeply intertwined the sport is with the
        country's cultural fabric.
